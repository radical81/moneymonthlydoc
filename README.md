Money Monthly helps you keep track of your expenses. In the main menu, you are given four options: To input your monthly income, track your spending, view your expenses history, and check the status of your monthly expenses.

While the app is not meant to replace other finance software youâ€™re already using, it does help you note your expenses as you go about your day. As you shop, you may simply save the amount, date, description, and even take a picture of your receipt. This especially helps for small purchases like food and drinks.
